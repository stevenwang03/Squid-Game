# Squid-Game

In the hit 2021 Netflix Korean drama Squid Game, bankrupt individuals are gathered from around Korea to compete in a competition of traditional Korean children's games. After one round, they soon realize that the cost of losing is brutal death.

In this intro-level Java text game, I take you through the sinister journey that is Squid Game. You will compete in four horrific games of death in a heartwrenching storyline, only in hopes of attaining 45.6 Million Won to redeem yourself.

Note: This game is a mere prototype that I developed throughout the course of 2.5 weeks. Major improvements can be made in object-oriented design, introduction of graphics, and efficiency.
